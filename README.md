# CustomGraphs
this is a code library to implement graphs who nodes hold generic c# types to avoid the need to reimplement graph theory algorthims across projects

Current features: base graph, graph node, and graph edge classes. Basic searches that return a list of the nodes reached. Tarjans SCC algorithim, and Khans topological sort algorithim.
