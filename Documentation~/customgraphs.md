## Overview

this is a unity package I have been developing to have a robust graph theory toolset across my projects. It is currently in its first open source alpha version 0.0.2. The current features of the pacakage are classes for representing directed / undirected graphs - and the special cases of trees and rooted trees. Classes for representing the components of a graph such as edges and nodes. Static classes for solving Tarjan's Strongly Connected Component on directed graphs, and for preforming Khan's Topological Sort or finding shortest paths on Directed Acyclic Graphs (called DAG's going forward). And lastly a D-ary heap data structure to test a use case of the rooted tree class.
